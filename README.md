â€¢ Vivid is a website designed for appointment scheduling for a hair salon.
â€¢ It has a form asking users to enter their preferred hair salon location, hairstylist, hairstyle, date, and time.
â€¢ After the client enters the data, a box will pop up asking for personal information such as name, email, etc.
â€¢ When a client books an appointment, their data is dispatched to a Redux state and saved using Redux Persist, allowing the website to store the history of all clients' booked appointments. This enables users to conveniently access all their booked appointments in a dedicated section of the page.
â€¢ Many things were taken into consideration, such as when the pop-up appears asking for personal information, the background becomes darker and blurry so the focus is all on the pop-up. Then, upon clicking the background, the pop-up goes away.
